I am currently advancing my academic journey as a Master's degree student at the School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, as part of their Interdisciplinary Graduate Program. My research, under the dedicated supervision of **Prof. [Guang Feng](http://itp.energy.hust.edu.cn/info/1003/1024.htm)**, is an extension of my academic pursuits. Prior to this, I was privileged to earn my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Nanjing Normal University, China, in 2022, under the nurturing guidance of **Prof. [Jing Qi](http://energy.njnu.edu.cn/info/1204/7387.htm)**.

My  research  is primarily centered around the nanoscale heat transport behavior of electrochemical solid-liquid interfaces, with specific emphasis on batteries and supercapacitors. My work involves exploring the **microscopic heat transfer mechanisms** and **examining the influence of thermal fields and electric potential fields on device performance factors, such as capacitance and charging rate**. Additionally, I maintain a keen interest in harnessing the power of emerging **machine learning potentials to investigate chemical reactions at solid-liquid interfaces**.

**If you are interested to collaborate with me or just have a chat**, please feel free to email me (tannxi99@gmail.com)! I am always happy to discuss with / learn from brilliant minds ^_^!
