I am currently advancing my academic journey as a Master's degree student at the School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, as part of their Interdisciplinary Graduate Program. My research, under the dedicated supervision of **Prof. [Guang Feng](http://itp.energy.hust.edu.cn/info/1003/1024.htm)**, is an extension of my academic pursuits. Prior to this, I was privileged to earn my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Nanjing Normal University, China, in 2022, under the nurturing guidance of **Prof. [Jing Qi](http://energy.njnu.edu.cn/info/1204/7387.htm)**.

My research delves into the intricacies of atomic-level interfaces and transport phenomena within the **solid-liquid interface electric double layers (EDLs)**, with a particular focus on its **dynamic processes of formation and relaxation**, as well as the **entropy of interfacial formation**. I explore the underlying microscopic mechanisms of the entropy of interfacial formation, while devising regulatory strategies from a molecular and atomic standpoint. Additionally, I maintain a keen interest in harnessing the power of emerging **machine learning potentials to investigate electrochemical reactions at EDLs**.

If you're interested in collaborating or just want to have a chat, please feel free to email me at tannxi99@gmail.com! I am always open to discussions and eager to learn from others. ^_^!
