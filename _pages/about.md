I am pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Energy Research Institute @ NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/erian), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, under the [Interdisciplinary Graduate Program](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/graduate-college/admissions/programme/interdisciplinary-graduate-programme). My research is supervised by Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/). Prior to this, I completed my B.Sc. degree at Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2021, under the guidance of Prof. [Jiayi Zhang](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8946/).

I now serve as the Editor-in-Chief Assistant of [IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9739) (IEEE COMST). In 2022, the impact factor of IEEE COMST reached 35.6, which is the highest one in all IEEE journals/magazines. To further promote IEEE COMST, I am helping to run some social accounts, including Linkedin (@IEEE Communications Surveys And Tutorials), Twitter (@IEEECOMST), and WeChat Account (@IEEECOMST). Thanks for following!

My current research interests include, but are not limited to, Semantic Communications, Resource Allocation, Integrated Sensing And Communications, and Metaverse. Now I am working actively on **Generative AI in Intelligent networks**. Please refer to this [repository](https://hongyangdu.github.io/posts/3000/01/blog-post-6/) for the latest updates from our group!

**If you are interested to collaborate with me or just have a chat**, please feel free to email me (hongyang001@e.ntu.edu.sg)! I am always happy to discuss with / learn from brilliant minds ^_^!
