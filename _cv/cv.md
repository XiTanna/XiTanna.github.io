Skills and Hobbies:
======
* Skills:
	* **LAMMPS**: Conducted ReaxFF simulation research on oxidation corrosion of supercritical water in iron pipelines during undergraduate studies, with a bachelor's graduation project focused on the mechanism of ReaxFF pseudocapacitor supercapacitors under a constant potential. Presently, conducting molecular simulation research on supercapacitors under a constant potential.
	* **GROMACS**: Performed potentiostatic empirical potential molecular dynamics simulations on electrochemical solid-liquid interfaces, including Li and Zn aqueous batteries and supercapacitors.
	* **GPUMD/DeepMD**: Undertook machine learning potential training for the reaction at the electrochemical solid-liquid interface and molecular dynamics simulation research on related chemical reaction mechanisms. (For instance, the pseudocapacitive supercapacitor composed of KOH solution and NiHAB MOF).
	* **VASP**: Furnished AIMD and DFT static calculations essential for training machine learning potentials.
* Hobbies:
	* Travel.
