Skills and Hobbies:
======
* Skills:
	* LAMMPS: During my undergraduate studies, I conducted ReaxFF simulation research on the oxidation corrosion of supercritical water in iron pipelines. My bachelor's graduation project involved investigating the mechanism of ReaxFF pseudocapacitor supercapacitors under a constant potential. Currently, I'm carrying out molecular simulation research on supercapacitors under a constant potential.
	* GROMACS : Performed potentiostatic empirical potential molecular dynamics simulations of electrochemical solid-liquid interfaces (e.g. Li, Zn aqueous batteries, supercapacitors)
	* GPUMD/DeepMD: Carried out  machine learning potential training of electrochemical solid-liquid interface reaction and molecular dynamics simulation research of related chemical reaction mechanism. (Pseudocapacitive supercapacitor composed of KOH solution and NiHAB MOF)
	* VASP: Provided AIMD and DFT static calculations for training machine learning potentials.
* Hobbies:
	* Competitive Games.
	* travel, movie watching.
